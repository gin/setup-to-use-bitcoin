## Online bank/exchange choices:  
* Kraken.com  (SF, 2011): has many other cryptocurrencies  
0.26% taker (0.16% maker) fee for <$50,000 of transactions in the past 30 days ([source](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/fee-schedule))

* Coinbase.com  (SF, 2012): has many other cryptocurrencies  
0.5% taker (0.5% maker) fee for <$10,000 of transactions in the past 30 days ([source](https://pro.coinbase.com/fees))

* Gemini.com  (NY, 2014): bitcoin and ethereum only  
0.35% taker (0.25% maker) fee for <$500,000 of transactions in the past 30 days ([source](https://gemini.com/fees/activetrader-fee-schedule#active-trader))

* River.com  (SF, 2019): bitcoin only, and is up-to-date with bitcoin related technologies (e.g. Lightning Network payments for 0 fees and instant transfers)  
\>1.04% fee for transactions depending on order size ([source](https://river.com/support/knowledge-base/articles/fee-schedule))

### Upcoming bank/exchange choices:  
* [Zap](https://zaphq.io/) (Chicago, 2017): bitcoin only, has the latest bitcoin related technologies, but currently requires self-custody so it is for very advanced users (because if you lose your private key, you lose your money)   
0 fees

### Ease of use (in my opinion):  
River.com > Coinbase.com > Kraken.com > Gemini.com
